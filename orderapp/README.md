Restaurant Restocking App
Aim: To make an restocking app for restaurants to restock items
as a checklist that automatically configures a whatsapp message
to send to suppliers.

Rationale: There are 101 items to order in a restaurant, and staff
often forget to order certain items. With this restocking app,
staff will go through the checklist that is pre-configured, with a simple + or - button, they will record down what they need and it will turn into a whatsapp message and with a single click the work is done, reducing the restocking work into a breeze.
